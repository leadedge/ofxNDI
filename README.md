## ofxNDI
An Openframeworks addon to allow sending and receiving images over a network using the NewTek Network Device Protocol.

## Updates
06.08.18 - Updated for NDI SDK Vers 3.5 Visual Studio 2017 and Openframeworks 10.

Significant changes have been made for this version. The original classes have been renamed :

    ofxNDIsender > ofNDIsender
    ofxNDIreceiver > ofNDIreceive

The same functions remain, but with additions to support the new classes. For existing applications, you can still use them directly by simply renaming the class names, and including the header files specifically. The significance is that they are not dependent on Openframeworks, so can be used in other applications. 

The new class files depend on Openframeworks and are much easier to use. There are now options to send and receive using ofFbo, ofTexture, ofPixels as well as an unsigned char pixel buffer. 

If receiving to Openframeworks fbo, texture of pixels, it is no longer necessary to manage sender size change rom the application. Also it is no longer necessary to handle receiver creation. Simply use the receive functions alone.

The sender includes pbo pixel buffer readback within the class itself, activated by SetReadback.

NDIlib_FourCC_type_UYVY sending format is supported by way of a shader for increased efficiency. Default format is NDIlib_FourCC_type_BGRA.

New functions for the receiver include :

    bool ReceiverCreated();
    bool ReceiveImage(ofFbo &fbo);
    bool ReceiveImage(ofTexture &texture);
    bool ReceiveImage(ofImage &image);
    bool ReceiveImage(ofPixels &pixels);
    NDIlib_frame_type_e GetFrameType();
    bool GetSenderName(char *sendername, int maxsize, int index = -1);
    std::string GetSenderName(int index = -1);
    unsigned int GetSenderWidth();
    unsigned int GetSenderHeight();
	NDIlib_frame_type_e GetFrameType();
    double GetFps();
	
and for the sender :

    bool UpdateSender(unsigned int width, unsigned int height, NDIlib_FourCC_type_e colorFormat);
	bool SenderCreated();
	unsigned int GetWidth();
	unsigned int GetHeight();
    std::string GetSenderName();
	bool SendImage(ofFbo fbo, bool bInvert = false);
	bool SendImage(ofTexture tex, bool bInvert = false);
	bool SendImage(ofImage img, bool bInvert = false);
	bool SendImage(ofPixels pix, bool bInvert = false);
	void SetFrameRate(int framerate);
	void SetFrameRate(double framerate);
	double GetFps();
	void SetReadback(bool bReadback = true);
	bool GetReadback();
	
Refer to the header files for details.

Examples have been updated to include all options available. For a simple, practical example, refer to the webcam sender. The examples assume Openframeworks 10 and are not compatible with previous versions.

31.03.18 - Updated for NDI SDK Vers 3
Search source for "Vers 3"
Note changes to function argument variable types to match with Version 3.

## Setup

For Windows

1. Add files from "ofxNDI" to your Visual Studio project.
2. Copy .dll's from ofxNDI/libs to the application "bin" folder
3. [Register with Newtek](http://pages.newtek.com/NDI-Developers.html) for the NDI SDK. Install the NewTek SDK and copy files as follows.
	- Copy the files in  "../NewTek NDI 3.5 SDK/Include" to "ofxNDI/include"
	- Copy the files in "../NewTek NDI 3.5 SDK/Lib" to "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Libs"

In your Visual Studio project properties :

- Add "ofxNDI/src" to additional "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
- Add "ofxNDI/include" to additional "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
For a 32bit project
- Add "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Libs/x86" to "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories"
- Add "Processing.NDI.Lib.x86.lib" to "Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies"
For a 64bit project
- Add "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Libs/x64" to "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories"
- Add "Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.lib" to "Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies"
- Add "#include ofxNDI.h" to your source header file


## Example sender
Copy the images from "ofxNDI/bin/data" to the application "bin/data" folder.

## Example receiver
Press 's' for a listing NDI senders. Press '0' to 'x' to select a sender. 

Refer to the example code for options available.
