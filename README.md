# ofxNDI
An Openframeworks addon to allow sending and receiving images over a network using the NewTek Network Device Protocol.

## Updates

The Project Generator copies the "rgba2yuv" shaders folder into the application.
However if the Project Generator is not used, this folder must be copied as below.

	bin
     data
        rgba2yuv

Note that for previous applications, the location of the "rgba2yuv" folder should be changed
from within a containing "shaders" folder to directly in "bin/data". Example binaries are included for testing.

--------------------------

ofxNDIsender update\
rgbg2Yuv shaders located in a "bin\data\rgbg2Yuv" folder instead of\
"bin\data\shaders\rgbg2Yuv" to avoid conflicts with over-write by Project Generator\

## Openframeworks

ofxNDIsender and ofxNDIreceiver depend on Openframeworks.

There are options to send and receive using ofFbo, ofTexture, ofPixels as well as an unsigned char pixel buffer. If receiving to ofFbo, ofTexture of ofPixels, it is not necessary to manage sender size change from the application. Nor is it necessary to handle receiver creation. Simply use the receive functions alone. For best efficiency, the sender class includes pbo pixel buffer readback, activated by SetReadback(). Refer to the header files for details. Examples have been updated to include all the options available. For a simple, practical example, refer to the webcam sender. The examples assume Openframeworks 10 and are not compatible with previous versions.

### Setup

For Windows

### Project Generator

The OF Project Generator will create your project with correct paths. Make sure "ofxNDI" is selected in the addons section and all headers, and DLLs will be imported in the Visual Studio project.

### Manual Setup

1. Add files from "ofxNDI" to your Visual Studio project. A new project filter such as "ofxNDI" recommended.
2. Copy .dll's from "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/export/vs/Win32" and "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/export/vs/x64" to the application "bin" folder
3. In your Visual Studio project properties
- Add "../../../addons/ofxNDI/src" to additional "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
- Add "../../../addons/ofxNDI/libs/NDI/include" to "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
- Add "#include ofxNDI.h" to your source header file

## Example sender
Copy the images from "ofxNDI/example-sender/bin/data" to the application "bin/data" folder.

## Example receiver
Press 's' for a listing NDI senders. Press '0' to 'x' to select a sender. 

Refer to the example code for options available.

## Sub-classes
ofxNDIsend and ofxNDIreceive classes can be used independently of Openframeworks for pixel buffer send and receive.

ofxNDIReceive manages receiver creation and sender name and size change. The receiving buffer size has to be manged from the application. Examples for Windows including Visual Studio project files are contained in the "example-windows" folder.

The Visual Studio solutions "WinSenderNDI.sln" and "WinReceiverNDI.sln" can be opened and built using the addon folder structure.\
After build, copy "Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.dll" from "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/export/vs/x64" to the x64\Release or x64\debug folder.\
Pre-built binaries are included in "example-binaries".

### Setup

To move the project to another folder :
1. Move the entire contents of either the examples-windows\Sender or examples-windows\Receiver folder to the destination.
2. Create a new folder "ofxNDI" within the Sender or Receiver folder.
3. Copy all the files from ofxND\src to the new folder except for :\
    ofxNDIreceiver.cpp, ofxNDIreceiver.h, ofxNDIsender.cpp, ofxNDIsender.h
4. Copy the "ofxNDI\lib" folder and contents to the new folder.
5. In your Visual Studio project properties :\
    [C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories]\
    Change "..\..\libs\NDI\Include" and "..\..\src" to "ofxNDI\libs\NDI\Include" and and "ofxNDI\src".
7. Remove all the files from the project "ofxNDI" filter.
8. Replace them with all the files in the new "ofxNDI" folder.
