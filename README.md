## ofxNDI
An Openframeworks addon to allow sending and receiving images over a network using the NewTek Network Device Protocol.

## testing branch

ofxNDIsender and ofxNDIreceiver depend on Openframeworks. There are options to send and receive using ofFbo, ofTexture, ofPixels as well as an unsigned char pixel buffer. If receiving to ofFbo, ofTexture of ofPixels, it is not necessary to manage sender size change from the application. Nor is it necessary to handle receiver creation. Simply use the receive functions alone. For best efficiency, the sender class includes pbo pixel buffer readback, activated by SetReadback(). Refer to the header files for details. Examples have been updated to include all the options available. For a simple, practical example, refer to the webcam sender. The examples assume Openframeworks 10 and are not compatible with previous versions.

ofxNDIsend and ofxNDIreceive classes can be used independently for applications other than Openframeworks. Sender size update and receiving buffer size change have to be manged from the application.

## Setup

For Windows

### Project Generator

The OF Project Generator will create your project with correct paths. Make sure "ofxNDI" is selected in the addons section and all headers, and DLLs will be imported in the Visual Studio project.

### Manual Setup

1. Add files from "ofxNDI" to your Visual Studio project.
2. Copy .dll's from "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/export/vs/Win32" and "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/export/vs/x64" to the application "bin" folder
3. In your Visual Studio project properties :
- Add "ofxNDI/src" to additional "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
- Add "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/include" to  "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
- Add "#include ofxNDI.h" to your source header file

## Example sender
Copy the images from "ofxNDI/example-sender/bin/data" to the application "bin/data" folder.
