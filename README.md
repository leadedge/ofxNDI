## ofxNDI
An Openframeworks addon to allow sending and receiving images over a network using the NewTek Network Device Protocol.

## Updates
31.03.18 - Updated for NDI SDK Vers 3. Search source for "Vers 3"\
(Note changes to function argument variable types to match with Version 3.)\
06.08.18 - Updated for NDI SDK Vers 3.5 Visual Studio 2017 and Openframeworks 10.\
10.03.19 - Updated for NDI SDK Vers 3.8\
10.11.19 - Updated for NDI SDK Vers 4.0

With update to NDI 4.0, shaders have been removed. All buffers need to be RGBA or BGRA and for a sender, conversion to other formats are handled by the NDI API. Default receiving format is BGRA, and conversion to RGBA is made within the ofxNDIreceiver class. Experimental audio functions are included but not tested.

ofxNDIsender and ofxNDIreceiver depend on Openframeworks. There are options to send and receive using ofFbo, ofTexture, ofPixels as well as an unsigned char pixel buffer. If receiving to ofFbo, ofTexture of ofPixels, it is not necessary to manage sender size change from the application. Nor is it necessary to handle receiver creation. Simply use the receive functions alone. For best efficiency, the sender class includes pbo pixel buffer readback, activated by SetReadback(). Refer to the header files for details. Examples have been updated to include all the options available. For a simple, practical example, refer to the webcam sender. The examples assume Openframeworks 10 and are not compatible with previous versions.

ofxNDIsend and ofxNDIreceive classes can be used independently for applications other than Openframeworks. Sender size update and receiving buffer size change have to be manged from the application.

## Setup

For Windows

### Project Generator

The OF Project Generator will create your project with correct paths. Make sure "ofxNDI" is selected in the addons section and all headers, libraries, and DLLs will be imported in the Visual Studio project.

### Manual Setup

1. Add files from "ofxNDI" to your Visual Studio project.
2. Copy .dll's from ofxNDI/libs to the application "bin" folder
3. Got to the [NDI web page](https://www.ndi.tv/) and download the NDI SDK. Install the NewTek SDK and copy files as follows.
	- Copy the files in  "../NDI 4 SDK/Include" to "ofxNDI/include"
	- Copy the files in "../NDI 4 SDK/Lib" to "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Lib"

In your Visual Studio project properties :

- Add "ofxNDI/src" to additional "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
- Add "ofxNDI/include" to additional "C/C++/General/Additional Include Directories"
For a 32bit project
- Add "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Lib/x86" to "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories"
- Add "Processing.NDI.Lib.x86.lib" to "Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies"
For a 64bit project
- Add "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Lib/x64" to "Linker > General > Additional Library Directories"
- Add "Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.lib" to "Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies"
- Add "#include ofxNDI.h" to your source header file

NOTE: for existing projects, you will need to change "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Libs" to ofxNDI/libs/NDI/Lib". This is in keeping with the NDI folder naming.

## Example sender
Copy the images from "ofxNDI/bin/data" to the application "bin/data" folder.

## Example receiver
Press 's' for a listing NDI senders. Press '0' to 'x' to select a sender. 

Refer to the example code for options available.
