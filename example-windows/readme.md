## ofxNDI Windows examples

Sender and Receiver example projects are based on the basic Windows Desktop Application project generated by Visual Studio. The application code has been adapted for NDI output using the the ofxNDIsend and ofxNDIreceive classes independent of Openframeworks.

The sender captures the application window using Windows bitmap functions and sends a pixel buffer. The receiver receives to a pixel buffer and display the output using Windows bitmap functions. Details are documented in the respective source files. Refer to the example code for options available.

Sending and receiving functions are performed using the CPU by NDI design and there is no overhead for download and upload to GPU textures. 

Visual Studio 2022 projects are provided for each example and will build using the directory structure of the ofxNDI addon.

Copy "Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.dll" from "ofxNDI/libs/NDI/export/vs/x64" to the application "Release\64" folder.

Although the examples are for Windows, the library functions and application methods should be compatible for all platforms supported by ofxNDI.
