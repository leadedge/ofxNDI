Install the NDI 6 Runtime for the required dll files. The installation will update to the current NDI version.

Windows : http://ndi.link/NDIRedistV6
MacOS: http://ndi.link/NDIRedistV6Apple
Linux: https://downloads.ndi.tv/SDK/NDI_SDK_Linux/Install_NDI_SDK_v6_Linux.tar.gz

Or for Windows you can retain NDI version 6.1.1.0 by copying dlls from the addon to the application executable folder for either a 32 bit or 64bit application or both.
